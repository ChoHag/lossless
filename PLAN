Short term goals:

REPL


Medium term goals:

Continuations
Tail call whateveritscalleding
Threads


Long term goals:

Complete implementation of r4rs, r5rs &// r7rs sans some things like
        modules, exceptions that lossless will do differently.
I/O
Graphics
BASIC
Relations via postgres
Floating point


Distant goals:

Editor/debugger
Integrate with other runtimes:
        r[4567]rs - complete
        perl - easy, I know it, some hard parts done already
        python - common, lots of shitty but useful libraries
        javascript - web shite
        emacs - need at least 1 lisp, comes with a shitty editor
        sbcl - better lisp
        java - fucking java
        ksh - a shell for fun and fuck bash
        c
Truly integrated relations
