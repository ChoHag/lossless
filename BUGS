For the moment bugs or missing features I've noted as lossless has
been developed are marked by @.TODO@> in lossless.w which includes
them in the TODO section in the index. The associated section also
includes a TODO marker somewhere describing what's the broken part.

Lossless should build, even if it doesn't do much, on any complete
computer, ie. a proper unix or one of the toys they call computers
with the necessary build tools installed. README list the packages
which need to be installed then make all or test should `just work'.

If it doesn't, or if you find a bug or have an idea or even a diff
file suggesting an improvement, please email it to chohag@jtan.com.
