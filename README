To build on OpenBSD:

        make DEBUG=-DLDEBUG     # To enable stdio-based printing

        Alternatively set it in the environment:
        export DEBUG=-DLDEBUG

        No optimisation and better debugging symbols are also helpful:
        export DEBUG=-DLDEBUG -O0 -g

Useful targets:

        make lossless           Lossless executable

        make liblossless.so     As a linkable object

        make ffi.perl           Perl wrapper

        make test               Run losslees through a comprehensive test suite

The available documentation can be read from within the development
directory by updating MANPATH:

        MANPATH=:$PWD/man

        make man/mandoc.db      Rebuild the manual pages' index

Dependencies:

        C compiler
        TeX *
        CWEB *

        The makefile has been tuned to work equally with BSD and GNU make.

        The REPL, which is very much a work in progress, depends on the
        editline library built into BSD.

CWEB and TeX are both part of the astronomically huge TeX Live
distribution. The necessary parts can be installed on OpenBSD with
"pkg_add texlive_texmf-minimal". Debian-based Linux distributions
require "texlive-extra-utils". Reports for other systems and
distributions are welcome --- the file you need which will ultimately
pull in all the necessary TeX parts is "cwebmac.tex".

[*] Optional; TeX is required to produce the PDF files which aren't
needed to build and run lossless and CWEB generates the C source
and header files which are already included in the tarball distribution.
