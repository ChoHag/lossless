NOTE:   The Lossless interpreter has not yet integrated I/O.

        In order to see anything you will need to compile with
        -DLDEBUG to enable stdio-based printing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building Lossless is a two stage process: the first stage, which
can be bypassed, processes the CWEB sources (*.w) to produce the
printer (*.tex) and C (*.c & *.h) sources. The second stage compiles
the C sources or prints the literature.

The Makefile has been adapted to work on BSD and GNU make but this
is probably an impossible pipe dream in the long term. Apart from
the author's OpenBSD, Lossless has so far been known to build on
Debian (et al) and FreeBSD.

TeX/CWEB:

        The first build stage requires CWEB by Donald Knuth et al.
        This is distributed as part of the astronomically huge TeX
        Live system from https://tug.org/texlive/ which is available
        in most unix systems (OpenBSD calls its "texlive_texmf-minimal";
        Debian and derivatives use "texlive-extra-utils"; to find
        the package yours provides it in look for one which contains
        the file "cwebmac.tex").

        The whole of TeX Live isn't necessary (TeX isn't needed to
        run Lossless at all, only for the printable literature); instead
        the original (tiny) CWEB can be downloaded from DEK's
        website. It has no dependencies other than a C compiler[*].
        Get it from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html

        Alternatively, even that isn't necessary --- the intermediate
        sources have been prepared in a downloadable archive available
        from http://zeus.jtan.com/~chohag/lossless/.

Quirks:

        The hack which stands in for a real REPL requires perl to
        build (see bin/lloader) and links against libedit at run-time
        to read user input.

To build on OpenBSD:

        $ make DEBUG=-DLDEBUG

        Set DEBUG in the environment for convenience:
        $ export DEBUG='-DLDEBUG'
        $ make

        DEBUG comes via CFLAGS so be sure to include $(DEBUG) if
        CFLAGS is customised.

Useful targets:

        $ make # or make all      Everything

        $ make clean all          Everything from scratch

        $ make lossless           Lossless executable

        $ make liblossless.so     As a linkable object

        $ make ffi.perl           Perl wrapper

        $ make test               Run losslees through a comprehensive test suite

The available documentation can be read from within the development
directory by updating MANPATH:

        $ MANPATH=:$PWD/man
        $ make man/mandoc.db      Rebuild the manual pages' index

        nb. makewhatis includes backup files (*~) in its index.

[*] It's amazing to think that 40 year old code hasn't picked up
    any crutches to keep it going and that it still builds as-is
    on the systems today but that's what you come to expect with
    Donald Knuth.
