GNU. The gift that keeps on giving.

The unprintable character sitting on its own on the line before the
content starts is named 'us' and has value 0x1f, for reasons which
I'm sure make perfect sense but I genuinely do not wish to know.

This is lossless.info, produced by makeinfo version who cares then
hacked by hand.

Lossless
********

Lossless documentation is maintained in several formats which are
not texinfo manuals, composed using the ancient art of writing words
in order from start to finish.

If your system has Lossless installed then they are likely found in

    /usr/local/share/doc/lossless/

If they are ever written unix manual pages can be found by typing

    man lossless

Finally Lossless has an unofficial home on the web at

    http://zeus.jtan.com/~chohag/lossless/
