All of the code I have written is released under the license: WTFPL
version 2 (included below) or, at your option, any compatible license
that you wish.

Some of the code I have copied may be licensed under a BSD or MIT
variant license and is copyright them. Honestly I don't think there
is any but I'm hedging my bets. This project is based mostly on
s9fes which was effectively free of all licenses being "in the
public domain", whatever that means. Citations and copyright notices
will follow in due course. I'm a programmer, Jim, not a lawyer.
